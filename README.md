# Louie's Fantasy Football Analysis App

https://louier3-fantasy-football-page.streamlit.app/

This site analyzes a few ESPN fantasy I or a friend are in and provides 
* a grid of every team's schedule if they were to play every other team's schedule
* a list of easiest to hardest schedule
* a list of expected wins for each team
* and the all important, Louie Power Index, as a way to rank teams in a league

Things to add:
* strength of schedule for rest of season based on LPI or something
* chart showing LPI trending week by week
* better styling for difference between expected wins and record
* color actual record in grid of records better
* playoff predictor
* change of LPI from last week
